# utils
Useful functions and notes I carry around from task to task

* `langs`: Programming language utils, c++, python, etc.
* `tools`: Notes and config for exe's that are NOT platform-specific, vim, netshark, jenkins, etc.
* `systems`: OS-level config details, scripts specific to Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
