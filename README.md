# utils
Useful functions and notes I carry around from task to task

* `dotfiles`: Notes on daily-use tools that have config files (drop-in for `~/.config`) (vim, ssh, git, etc.)
* `tools`: For tools that are less-frequently config'd (jenkins, sed, etc.)
* `langs`: Programming language utils, c++, python, etc.
* `systems`: OS-level config details, scripts specific to Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
