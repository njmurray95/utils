# sed

> sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sedâ€™s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

### Running

`sed` should be installed on all unix systems, by default.

By default `sed` assumes editing is done on a stream. Hence, it prints directly to stdout:

```
$ sed SCRIPT INPUTFILE
```

And without an `INPUTFILE` sed will actually read directly from stdin.

In most cases it's easier to pipe into and out of `sed` than to invoke it directly. (There is also the `-i` for "inplace" to make `sed` read from and write to the same file.)

`Sed` commands also comes built into vim within the `:` operator, i.e.:

`:s/one/two/g/'`

### Misc.

Find replace all:
```
sed -i  's/a\.example\.com/b.example.com/g' [files]
```
