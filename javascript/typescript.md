# TypeScript

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

> -- TypeScript Homepage: https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html

Developed by Microsoft and released in 2012, TypeScript was designed to offer the benefits of static typing within JavaScript without obviating JavaScript.

Beware!

> You can use TypeScript even if there are errors in your code. But in this case, TypeScript is warning that your code will likely not run as expected.
