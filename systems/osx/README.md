# Overview

Apple makes it difficult to configure things, by design. Most config here happens at the menu level and therefore requires documentation instead of proper config.

# Menu Bar

With El Capitan the ability to reskin Aqua has been removed. But the actual system menu bar can be moderately adjusted.

"System Preferences" -> "General" to "Use dark menu bar". "Automatically hide and show the menu bar" also gives back an extra half centimeter of screen space.
