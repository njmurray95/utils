# cmd.exe

> CMD, cmd (after its command name) or cmd.exe (after its executable file name), also known as Command Prompt (after the default window title), is the command-line interpreter in the OS/2, eComStation, Windows NT, Windows CE, and ReactOS operating systems. It is the counterpart of COMMAND.COM in DOS and Windows 9x systems, and analogous to the Unix shells used on Unix-like systems.
