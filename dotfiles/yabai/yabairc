# Because macbooks have changed to arm64, yabai currently cannot inject code
# to enable certain features; these are currently impossible:

# focus/create/destroy space without animation
# move space (and its windows) left, right or to another display
# remove window shadows
# enable window transparency
# control window layers (make windows appear topmost)
# sticky windows (make windows appear on all spaces)
# move window by clicking anywhere in its frame
# toggle picture-in-picture for any given window
# border for focused and inactive windows

# TODO:
# Reinstall yabai when fix is posted
# Make active windows less transparent than active windows
# Make active windows border different
#
# TODO:
# Idea: When SIP disable yabai --load-sa works correctly:
# One display with 7 open Alacritty instances
# Jerry-rig so always in BSP mode
# Whichever window is active gets moved to slot 1; all others get demoted
